# CSS `calc()` Issues

This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues that can arise when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `bug.css` file shows examples of incorrect usage, leading to unexpected layout or rendering problems.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides corrected versions, illustrating how to avoid these pitfalls. The issues include incorrect unit handling within `calc()` expressions, unexpected behavior when combined with percentages and undefined parent widths, and complexity arising from nested calculations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` (you'll need to create a simple HTML file to see the CSS effects).
3. Observe the unexpected behavior in the layout compared to the expected layout demonstrated in the solution.
