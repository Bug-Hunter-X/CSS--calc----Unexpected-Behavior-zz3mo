The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another common issue is nesting `calc()` expressions, which can become complex and difficult to debug.  Incorrect unit usage within the calculation (mixing pixels and percentages without proper conversion) can also result in unexpected output.
